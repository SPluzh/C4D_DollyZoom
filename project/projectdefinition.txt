// from a domain name you own, followed by plugin qualifiers, e.g, "net.mycompany.mymodule" or
// "net.mycompany.mysuite.mymodule". It is important that this ID is unique, as Cinema 4D will
// not load two modules with the same ID. Please note that Cinema 4D will also not load modules
// with a "net.maxon" domain, as this domain is reserved for Maxon modules.
